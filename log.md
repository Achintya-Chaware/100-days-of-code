**Progress:**
I am now coming back to The Odin Project; I learnt about developer tools today. I also got started with a project in The Odin Project where I have to recreate the Google Homepage. 

**Thoughts:** The project seems pretty exciting as it is a test of the things that I learned until now. Hoping to finish it quickly.
