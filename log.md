### Day 1 to 7: March 9, 2021 to March 15, 2021
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Progress**:
- Got started with the odin project
- Did basics of command line
- Installed Ubuntu on a bootable falsh drive
- Installed VS Code, Installed plugins
- Did basics of web
- Did basics of HTML and HTML5 from responsive web design course on FreeCodeCamp (28 lessons)

**Thoughts:** Ubuntu installation was very tideous. On the other hand, HTML is amazingly easy! I knew from people that it is easy but didn't know that it's plain English. Also, how the internet works is amazing!
