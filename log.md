# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 to 7: March 9, 2021 to March 15, 2021
<!--##### (delete me or comment me out)-->

**Progress:**
- Got started with the odin project
- Did basics of command line
- Installed Ubuntu on a bootable falsh drive
- Installed VS Code, Installed plugins
- Did basics of web
- Did basics of HTML and HTML5 from responsive web design course on FreeCodeCamp (28 lessons)

**Thoughts:** Ubuntu installation was very tideous. On the other hand, HTML is amazingly easy! I knew from people that it is easy but didn't know that it's plain English. Also, how the internet works is amazing!

###  Day 8: March 16, 2021

**Progress:**
Did the Basic CSS part (44 lessons) of the FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This covered classes, properties of text, colours and coloue systems, padding and margins and various ways of declaring them, overriding, fallback, inheritance, etc.

**Thoughts:** Did not face any difficulty today. The baby penguin in the exercises was super cute! Also, it was a productive day.
